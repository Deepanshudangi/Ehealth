                1. Mountain Pose<br>
                Sanskrit: Tadasana

            </h3>

                <img src="/UI/images/tadasan.gif" alt="Burpee"><br><br>
            <h1 style="color: chartreuse;">How to do it></h1><br>
            <p style="color: rgb(8, 123, 255);"> Stand with your feet together or hip-width apart. Ground down through
                the four
                corners of your feet.
                Roll your shoulders away from your ears, draw your shoulder blades down your back, and lift the crown of
                your head.

                Engage your thighs, draw your belly button in, and lengthen up through the spine. Turn your palms facing
                the front of the room. Relax your jaw and unfurrow your brow. Breathe easy.

                The benefits
                It may seem like you’re, well, just standing there, but bear with us. This is the blueprint for all
                other poses. It promotes balance and directs your attention to the present moment.

            <h1 style="color: chartreuse;">How to do it></h1><br>
            <p style="color: rgb(8, 123, 255);"> Start in Mountain Pose. As you inhale, raise your arms, spread your
                fingers, and
                reach up through your
                fingertips. As you exhale,sit back and down as if sitting into a chair. Shift your weight toward the
                heels
                and lengthen up through the spine. As you inhale,lift and lengthen through your arms. As you exhale, sit
                deeper into the pose.

                The benefits
                This heating standing pose (give it a minute, you’ll feel the burn) strengthens your legs, upper back,
                and
                shoulders.
                As a bonus, you’ll have an opportunity to practice patience as your thighs work hard. Just remember to
                breathe.

                <img src="/UI/images/trikosana.gif" alt="Burpee"><br><br>
            <h1 style="color: chartreuse;">How to do it></h1><br>
            <p style="color: rgb(8, 123, 255);"> Stand with feet wide, 3–4 feet apart. Shift your right heel out so your
                toes are
                pointing slightly inward.
                Turn your
                left foot out 90 degrees. Line up your left heel with the arch of your right foot. Keeping both legs
                straight, ground
                through your feet. Lift arms into a T at shoulder height. Reach forward with your front arm. When you
                can’t
                reach anymore,
                hinge at the front hip. Bring your front arm down to your shin, a foam block, or the ground. Lift your
                back
                arm up toward
                the sky and spread your fingers. Take your gaze down to the floor or up toward your lifted hand.

                The benefits
                While this pose can be challenging for those with tight muscles, it will help promote balance, stretch
                the
                hamstrings and
                inner thighs, and create a feeling of expansion in the body.

            <p style="color: rgb(8, 123, 255);"> Start in Mountain Pose. Find a fixed point in front of you and stare at
                it to help
                you balance. As you
                inhale, shift the
                weight into your left foot and lift your right foot an inch off the floor. Using your right hand, bring
                the
                foot to your
                shin or inner thigh. Avoid placing your foot directly on the knee. As you exhale, ground through the
                standing leg and lengthen
                through the crown of your head. Bring your palms to touch in front of your sternum into prayer hands.

                The benefits
                This pose helps improve concentration and your ability to balance by strengthening the arches of the
                feet
                and the outer hips.</p>

            <p style="color: rgb(8, 123, 255);"> Sitting on the floor, bend knees and open them out to the side like a
                book. Join
                the soles of your feet
                together while sitting
                upright. Place fingertips on the floor directly behind you and lengthen up through the spine. You can
                also
                hold onto your ankles
                and hinge forward at the hips.

                Pro tip: If you’re feeling stiff, sit on the edge of a blanket to help your forward fold.

                The benefits
                You’ll give your inner thighs and groin a nice stretch, while the forward bend creates a calming,
                cooling
                effect.

                sides. Place arms along
                sides, palms facing up. Close your eyes and relax.

                The benefits
                Yep, it’s as simple as it sounds. Every yoga class includes Savasana, which relaxes the whole body and
                gives
                you space to absorb
                the benefits of the practice.

                in toward your spine
                and keep your hips from dropping. Reach heels back as you lengthen the crown of your head forward.
                Ground
                down into hands, pushing
                the floor away beneath you. Lengthen through the arms and broaden your chest.

                arms back
                behind you. Bend your knees
                so that your feet are near

                back

                shoulders.
                It also gives a nice massage
